# PX-Scripts
PX-Scripts is just a simple repo of any scripts I make for [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)/[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

All before 2016 are designed with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.  
Any after that are created with [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.

Most are for [KAT.cr](https://kat.cr/) (Kickass Torrents) - Some will not work as they are for advanced users.  
Others are just random from when I'm bored.  
And soon I will be adding some for [PXIMG](https://pximg.xyz/).
