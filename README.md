# PX-Scripts
PX-Scripts is just a simple repo of any scripts I make for Greasemonkey.

All before 2016 are designed with Greasemonkey for Firefox.
Any after that are created with Tampermonkey for Chrome.

Most are for [KAT.cr](https://kat.cr/) (Kickass Torrents) - Some will not work as they are for advanced users.
Others are just random from when I'm bored.
And soon I will be adding some for [PXIMG](https://pximg.xyz/).
